# Acrolinx Sidebar Interface

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acrolinx/sidebar-interface.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/acrolinx/sidebar-interface)

This project contains the [Acrolinx Sidebar Interface documentation](https://acrolinx.github.io/sidebar-interface/)
generated from its [TypeScript source](./src/index.ts).

For the most use cases you don't have to use the Acrolinx Sidebar Interface directly, but can use instead the [Acrolinx SDKs](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=sdk).

## Live Demo

[Acrolinx Sidebar Web Live Demo](https://acrolinx.github.io/acrolinx-sidebar-demo/samples/index.html)

## The Acrolinx Sidebar

The Acrolinx Sidebar is designed to show up beside the window where you edit your content.
You use it for checking, reviewing, and correcting your content.
To get an impression what the Sidebar looks like in existing integrations, have a look at
[Get Started With the Sidebar](https://docs.acrolinx.com/coreplatform/latest/en/the-sidebar/get-started-with-the-sidebar).

## Prerequisites

Please contact [Acrolinx SDK support](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance/blob/master/topics/sdk-support.md)
for consulting and getting your integration certified.
This sample works with a test license on an internal Acrolinx URL.
This license is only meant for demonstration and developing purposes.
Once you finished your integration, you'll have to get a license for your integration from Acrolinx.
  
Acrolinx offers different other SDKs, and examples for developing integrations.

Before you start developing your own integration, you might benefit from looking into:

* [Getting Started with Custom Integrations](https://docs.acrolinx.com/customintegrations),
* the [Guidance for the Development of Acrolinx Integrations](https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance),
* the [Acrolinx SDKs](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=sdk), and
* the [Acrolinx Demo Projects](https://github.com/acrolinx?q=demo).

### Installation Via NPM

For the most use cases you don't have to use the Acrolinx Sidebar Interface directly,
but can use instead the [Acrolinx Sidebar JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/acrolinx/sidebar-sdk-js).

```bash
npm install @acrolinx/sidebar-interface
```
